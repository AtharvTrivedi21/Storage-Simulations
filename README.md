Simulation of Extendible Hashing and Bitmap Indexing


This project is a Streamlit-based simulation of Extendible Hashing and Bitmap Indexing, two fundamental database indexing techniques. The interactive app provides real-time visualizations, demonstrating how these methods optimize data retrieval and storage efficiency.

Extendible Hashing dynamically adjusts its structure using directory-based hashing, ensuring efficient insertions, deletions, and lookups. Bitmap Indexing represents categorical data in a compact binary format, enabling fast query execution through bitwise operations. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding indexing mechanisms in database systems.
